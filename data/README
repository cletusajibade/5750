** ga-sentiment-train.csv, ga-sentiment-test.csv **

This is a dataset of Irish language tweets, labeled by positive (1)
or negative (0) sentiment. Each row of the training and test CSVs
corresponds to a single tweet. The first entry in each row is the label.
The rest of the entries are the indices of the words in the tweet
taken from a fixed vocabulary (the 5001 words in ga-sentiment-vocab.txt).
Note that the final word (index 5000) is a special out-of-vocabulary
token "<UNK>" which is used for any words not in the remainder of
the vocabulary.
